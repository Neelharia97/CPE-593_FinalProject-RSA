# CPE-593_FinalProject-RSA
By Amanda Ly, Neel Haria, and Ghaith Arar
Implement RSA using a biginteger library. It doesn’t have to be production quality, but you would need to implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange and use AES-256 (you don’t have to write that) to exchange secret messages.


## Concerns: 
- RSA is having problems with decrypt (Amanda: I'm sure how to debug - been stuck on it for a week now)

## Tasks To Do: 
- Figure out RSA decrypt
- Begin writting final paper
- Put together final presentation

## Tasks Completed: 
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
